Recursive Palindrome 
Overview
This is a recursive algorithm designed to check whether a given string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forwards and backwards.

Usage
Input
The function isPalindrome(s) takes a single argument s, which is the string you want to check for palindrome status.

Output
The function returns true if the input string s is a palindrome, and false if it is not.
Base Cases
The algorithm handles two base cases:

If the input string has a length of 0 or 1, it's considered a palindrome.
If the first and last characters of the string match, the function recursively checks the substring in between.
Recursive Process
The algorithm compares the first and last characters of the string and recursively checks the substring in between. If all characters match and the base cases are satisfied, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.
